The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in creativity has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach problem-solving and innovation. In this chapter, we will explore case studies on the use of AI in creativity across various domains, including art, music, literature, and advertising.

Art
---

AI has been used in various ways to create art, including generating new pieces of art, enhancing existing pieces of art, and restoring damaged pieces of art. For example, the artwork "Portrait of Edmond de Belamy" was created by a Paris-based art collective called Obvious using a generative adversarial network (GAN), a type of machine learning algorithm. The GAN analyzed a dataset of 15,000 portraits from the 14th to 20th centuries to create a unique portrait that was then printed on canvas and sold at auction for $432,500.

Music
-----

AI has also been used in music to generate new pieces of music or enhance existing pieces of music. For example, AIVA (Artificial Intelligence Virtual Artist) is a platform that uses AI to compose original pieces of music based on user preferences. The platform has been used in various contexts, including film scores, video games, and advertising.

Literature
----------

AI has been used in literature to generate new pieces of writing or enhance existing pieces of writing. For example, the novel "1 the Road" by Jack Kerouac was reimagined using a neural network by a programmer named Ross Goodwin. Goodwin fed the neural network with the original text of the novel and had it generate new sentences and paragraphs based on the patterns and trends identified in the text.

Advertising
-----------

AI has been used in advertising to identify patterns and trends in consumer behavior data, generate personalized insights and recommendations, and create more effective marketing campaigns. For example, the company Persado uses AI to generate marketing messages and ad copy based on identified patterns in consumer behavior data. The platform has been used by various companies, including American Express, Expedia, and Vodafone.

Conclusion
----------

In conclusion, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in creativity offers new techniques and strategies to enhance and augment traditional approaches. Case studies across various domains, including art, music, literature, and advertising, demonstrate the potential of AI to generate new ideas or solutions based on identified patterns and trends. By incorporating AI-based tools and algorithms into creative decision-making processes, companies can leverage the power of data-driven insights while also promoting collaboration, diversity, and creativity.

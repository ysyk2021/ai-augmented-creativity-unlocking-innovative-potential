One of the most critical aspects of creativity is generating and exploring new ideas. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in creative idea generation and exploration offers new techniques and strategies to enhance and augment traditional approaches. In this chapter, we will explore two AI-augmented creativity techniques that can drive innovation and problem-solving.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
--------------------------------------

Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a type of machine learning algorithm that involves two neural networks: a generator and a discriminator. The generator creates new examples of data based on existing examples, while the discriminator evaluates the authenticity of the generated examples.

Applications of GANs in AI-based creativity include:

* Art: GANs can be used to generate new art styles or variations based on existing works.
* Music: GANs can be used to generate new music compositions based on existing works or user preferences.
* Product design: GANs can be used to generate new product designs based on identified trends and patterns in user behavior data.

Computational Creativity
------------------------

Computational creativity involves using computer programs to generate new ideas, solutions, or artifacts. Computational creativity can be applied to various domains, including art, music, literature, and advertising.

Applications of computational creativity in AI-based creativity include:

* Art: AI-based tools and algorithms can be used to generate new art styles or variations based on identified patterns and trends.
* Music: AI-based tools and algorithms can be used to generate new music compositions based on identified patterns and trends.
* Advertising: AI-based tools and algorithms can be used to generate personalized advertising campaigns based on identified patterns and trends in user behavior data.

Conclusion
----------

Generative adversarial networks and computational creativity are two AI-augmented creativity techniques that can drive innovation and problem-solving by generating and exploring new ideas. By incorporating AI-based tools and algorithms into these techniques, companies can leverage the power of data-driven insights while also upholding the values of ethics and responsibility.

However, it is essential to ensure that these techniques are used in a responsible and ethical manner, addressing issues related to privacy and security. By incorporating best practices for data collection and analysis, companies can leverage the power of AI while also upholding the values of ethics and responsibility.
